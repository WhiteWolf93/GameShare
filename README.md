# GameShare
This is an app firstly made to connect two different PC and stream the inputs keyboard over the other, allowing the use of The Binding of Isaac coop online (and may work with other games and stuff in the future).

This is in early development, which means it may have bugs, crashes and poor performance, any feedback will help on the development.

# Instructions
- Both of you download GameShare and run it.
- You need to have a LAN Application to connect or portforward, i suggest you using Log Me In Hamachi.
- The host should open The Binding of Isaac (I recommend doing it with Antibirth as it has a better coop right now).
- Click host on GameShare.
- Start a new Run.
- Your friend should put your ip (from your LAN app if you are using one) and click Connect.
- Once Connected your friend should press Enter and done.

# Known Bugs
- There is a little delay so if you press too fast a button it may not be recognized.
- The host can't control the character as it is overwrited by the application until both of you close the app.
- Some key combinations like ( ) or { } may not work while hosting and connected.
- It may crash in some low end Computers as it sends data too fast.
